# Tactical-Decision-Making-for-Autonomous-Driving

## Abstract
Using deep neural networks, it is possible to find and localize certain objects (e.g. cars, pedestrians, cyclists, or traffic signs etc.) on the images, which is an important milestone in the development of self-driving vehicles. This project gathers a collection of environments for decision-making in Autonomous Driving. Our goal is to train agents that can drive through a ‘highway’ environment safely using different observation and action spaces on different algorithms and evaluate which is the best way to observe an environment for autonomous vehicles.
